<br>
<br><strong>Demographic and Aggregate Information
</strong><br><br>In order to provide you with the best possible experience on our website, the SSU may also collect demographic and aggregate information from online visitors who access its website, social media and Public Relations channels. “Demographic information” is anonymous information such as age, gender and geographic location. “Aggregate information” is data about a group or category of services or users from which individual identities have been removed. Demographic and aggregate information is not considered personal information, as it does not permit the identification of an individual.
<br>
<br><strong>User Comments and Email
</strong><br><br>Our website, social media and Public Relations channels will sometimes invite users to provide us with their comments on our services or on certain programs. Users who wish to provide us with their comments will sometimes have the option of also providing us with their name and email address. We do not require users to provide us with such information, however. Comments provided to the SSU by users may be posted on our website, social media and Public Relations channels. Alongside such comments, we may also post the user’s first name and last initial as well as the city and province that this user has indicated he or she is from. However, we will take measures to prevent such postings from containing any personal information.
<br>
<br>If an online form or an email submitted by a user contains personal information, we will only use such personal information to the extent necessary to respond to any comment or question from such user. We will limit access to such personal information and will keep such personal information in a secure system. Although most online forms and email messages submitted by users are deleted after we respond, in certain cases hard copies or data extracts may be kept on file. Any such copy or any such information, to the extent it is personal, will also be stored in a secure location.
<br>
<br><strong>Disclosure of Your Personal Information
</strong><br><br>We may disclose demographic and aggregate information about our users and information that does not identify any individual.
<br>
<br>We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy:
<br>
<br>1.To our subsidiaries and/or affiliates.
<br>2.To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;are also bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;only in accordance with applicable data protection laws for the purposes for which it is&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;authorized under this Privacy Policy.
<br>3.We contractually require these third parties to keep personal information confidential and use&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it only for the purposes for which it is authorized under this Privacy Policy.
<br>4.To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.
<br>5.For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.

<br>7.To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; regulatory request.
<br>8.To enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, including for billing and collection&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; purposes.
<br>9.If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the&nbsp; &nbsp;SSU, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and SSUs for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
<br><br><strong>Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information
</strong><br><br>You may send us an email at info@srisriuniversity.edu.in to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
<br>
<br><strong>Safeguards to Protect Your Personal Information
</strong><br><br>The SSU maintains reasonable safeguards in an effort to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the personal information we collect. We also have implemented reasonable security measures in an effort to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Personal information collected by the SSU is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public (e.g., locked rooms), and access to that information is limited to employees who need the information to provide you with our products or services.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the website.
<br>
<br><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons and Log Files
</strong><br><br>Some of our sites use cookies. Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive when you visit a website. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when you return to the site, the site knows who you are and can personalize your visit. The cookies used on our website, social media and Public Relations channels are not linked to any personal information about you.
<br>
<br>We use cookies to collect information so that we can determine how to improve our website, social media and Public Relations channels by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular, to personalize the website and make recommendations based on products you have examined while visiting our website and to improve the website experience. As noted, the information collected by the cookies we use is not personal information, as it is not identifiable to you specifically. As technology advances and cookies provide more functionality, we expect to utilize them in different ways. If so, we will update this Privacy Policy to identify such new uses of cookies.
<br>
<br>Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, some areas of our website may not function properly if you do so. There are many sources for additional information about Internet cookies, and we encourage anyone concerned about the use of cookies to do more research on the topic so you can make an informed decision about accepting them from any site.
<br>
<br>The SSU also uses “web beacons” (also known as “web bugs,” “action tags,” “pixel trackers,” or “clear GIFs”), which are small, graphic images on a web page, web- based document or in an email message that are designed to allow us or a third party to collect certain information and monitor user activity on our sites. Web beacons are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixels) and have the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We may use web beacons to collect non-personal information such as the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the web beacon comes from, and the time it was activated (such as when you view the web page,advertisement or email that contains the web beacon). Web beacons can be linked to personal information, but we do not use web beacons that link to personal information. We may permit third parties to place web beacons on our sites, but these web beacons are not linked to personal information either.
<br>
<br>The SSU maintains log files, which contain Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. We do not link IP addresses to personal information. In general, we only use log files to monitor traffic on our website, social media and Public Relations channels and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of abuse, however, we may block certain IP addresses.
<br>
<br><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy
</strong><br><br>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we make such changes, we will post the changes and change the date at the top of the policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Where and how to ask questions or file complaints By providing personal information on this website you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such information by the SSU in such manner as set out in this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to the sharing of such information with third parties in accordance with the terms described above. If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding this Privacy Policy, please send an email to the following address: info@srisriuniversity.edu.in.</p>
